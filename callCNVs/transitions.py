#   likelihoods[s,e,cn] is the likehood of state cn for exon e in sample s
#   (NOCALL exons must have all likelihoods == -1)
# - exons: list of nbExons exons, one exon is a list [CHR, START, END, EXONID]
# - priors (ndarray dim nbStates): prior probabilities for each state
# - maxIED (int): max inter-exon distance for a pair of consecutive called exons
#   to contribute to the baseTransMatrix.

# adjustTransMatrix
# When distance between exons increases, the correlation between CN states of
# consecutive exons diminishes until at some point we simply expect the priors.

# from base probas to prior probas following a power law, until reaching the
# prior at d = dmax.
#
# Args:
# - transMatrix (ndarray dim 4*4): base transition probabilities between states
# - priors (ndarray dim 4): prior probabilities for each state
# - d [int]: distance between exons
# - dmax (float): distance where prior is reached
#
# Returns: adjusted transition probability matrix (ndarray dim 4*4)
